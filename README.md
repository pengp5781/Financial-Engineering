- **Asset Pricing**
Asset pricing has always been of fundamental importance to modern financial system. This is especially true when we are talking about pricing derivatives â€“ which grows in popularity ever since created and has surpassed the volume of actual stock market by far. In this project, I approached to price multiple kinds of options using both Monte Carlo Simulation and Lattice Method. Visualization of the different simulations was presented to clarify the difference between the 2 methods and their pros and cons were discussed later.
-  **Financial Robo Advisor**

  In this project, we designed and implemented a robot advisor that takes inputs from users through chating and then outputs investment strategy based on their preference. The robot was capable of listening to users about their amount of investment, preference in sectors and risk-tolerance level. The information collected was then communicated to backend program to decide which strategy to apply and return an optimal portfolio with a backtesting figure showing performance in last 3 years.
  
-  **MSFT stock price prdiction**

 The project was based on the Case 1 from the book "Machine Learning and Data Science Blueprints for finance" to predict Microsoft stock price. The goal was to beat the performance of proposed model and many reinforcments were added to achieve that. For example, more features like technical indicators and smoothing features were included to construct a better dataset and PCA was introduced to handle the overly large data. More realated machine learning models like XGBoost and LSTM were used. In addition, to make the results more robust, different financial metrics such as CAGR, Sharpe Ratio were used to evaluate the performance and we conducted a final White Reality Check to validate the performance as well.
